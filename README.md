# Question Answering of BioMedicle KG 

![diff image](https://www.js-craft.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/langchain-vs-langgraph.webp)

In the repo, we will discuss the question-answering of Biomedicle Knowledge Graph using a approach, where **we will use the natural language for query** and the information will be retrieved and **we can see the answer also in natural language format.**

SEEMS INTERESTING ❗

I performed the workflow of this task, in 2 ways
- Using LangChain
- Using LangGraph

As, name suggested, lanchain supported sequence-wise instruction and all the instructions performed in a sequencing manner, whereas langgraph worked in a stepwise manner, where we used multiple sub-Agent our all sub-tasks.

## LangChain:
The files are found at - `KG_RAG_LLM_GRAPH.ipynb` and `graph_kg_PROMPTING.ipynb`

As, from the image all the instruction and sub-tasks are performed sequentially, so when needed **we cannot backtrack or rethink about the process**.

## LangGraph

It's the advance Multi-Agent system by LangChain community.

File found at - `KG_langgraph.ipynb`

Here, the main and foremost advantage is, it performed all the instruction and sub-task step-wise (node specific), and when needed we can backtrack or use the reasoning.

## Why the LangGraph is more ROBUST than LangChain in our task ❓

**LangGraph moves you from being a user of a pre-built tool to the architect of a transparent, robust, and custom-fit reasoning engine.**

Let's use an analogy:
- **LangChain (e.g., GraphCypherQAChain)** is like buying a high-quality, pre-built car. It's fast, convenient, and works great for standard trips on well-paved roads.
- **LangGraph** is like being given a professional garage with an engine, chassis, and all the specialized parts. You assemble the car yourself. It takes more upfront effort, but you can build a custom Formula 1 racer designed specifically for the complex, high-stakes track of biomedical data.

### Comparison:
| Feature | LangChain (`GraphCypherQAChain`) Approach | LangGraph (Your New Agent) Approach |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Control & Transparency** | **Black Box.** The chain internally generates a query, executes it, and synthesizes an answer. You have very little visibility or control over these intermediate steps. | **Glass Box.** Every step (entity extraction, query generation, KG execution, vector search, final synthesis) is an explicit, inspectable node. You see the exact state after each step. |
| **Error Handling & Robustness** | **Brittle.** If any internal step fails (e.g., the final synthesis), the whole chain can fail silently, giving you a useless "I don't know" answer. | **Robust.** You can build custom logic at each step. If Cypher generation fails, you can route to a different path. If KG execution returns no data, you can rely solely on the vector context. |
| **Combining Data Sources** | **Difficult.** Designed to work with *one* primary source (the graph). Injecting context from a separate vector store into its hidden internal prompt is complex and unnatural. | **Natural & Stateful.** The `GraphState` object is a shared workspace. The KG node puts its findings there, the vector store node adds its context, and the final synthesis node uses both for a rich answer. |
| **Custom Logic & Prompts** | **Limited.** You can provide a custom prompt for Cypher generation, but it's only one piece of hidden machinery. You can’t control the final synthesis prompt as effectively. | **Unlimited.** Every node is powered by your own Python code and custom prompts. You have fine-grained control over the “brain” of each step, from entity extraction to the final answer. |
| **Debuggability** | **Painful.** When it fails, you have to guess which internal part broke. | **Simple.** The `app.stream()` output gives you a turn-by-turn “flight recording” of your agent’s thought process. You can pinpoint the exact node and state where things went wrong. |
| **Suitability for Your Task** | Good for **simple, direct lookups** on a graph. | Essential for **complex, multi-source, high-stakes question answering** where reliability and explainability are paramount. |


### Why LangGraph is the Definitive Choice for Your Biomedical KG Project
Let's translate this table into the specific problems you've faced and solved:
You Solved the "I Don't Know" Failure:
With LangChain: The GraphCypherQAChain got the data but failed to synthesize it, leaving you with no answer and no clue why.
With LangGraph: This failure is now architecturally impossible. The execute_cypher_node successfully puts the 100 results into the state. The generate_response_node is a separate step whose sole job is to turn that data into a sentence. You have full control over its prompt and logic, ensuring it always produces a meaningful output.
You Needed to Combine the KG and a Vector Store:
With LangChain: This is architecturally awkward. You would have to retrieve from the vector store first, then try to stuff that context into the question you pass to the GraphCypherQAChain, hoping it uses it correctly.
With LangGraph: This is elegant. The two retrieval processes run as parallel or sequential nodes, both contributing their findings to the central GraphState. The final synthesis node is explicitly designed to be the "merger" of this information. It's clean and predictable.
Your KG Requires Expert-Level Cypher Queries:
With LangChain: The default prompt is generic. It wouldn't know to use OPTIONAL MATCH or to group your specific biological relationships logically.
With LangGraph: Your generate_cypher_node is now a highly specialized "expert." It's armed with your custom, detailed prompt that knows the nuances of your schema, leading to far more accurate and comprehensive queries.
Trust and Explainability are Critical in Biomedicine:
With LangChain: If you get an answer, how do you trust it? You can't easily see the exact Cypher query that was run or the raw data it returned.
With LangGraph: You have a perfect audit trail. For any given answer, you can show the user (or a fellow researcher) the exact entities extracted, the precise Cypher query generated, and the raw data that formed the basis of the final natural language answer. This is essential for any scientific or medical application.
